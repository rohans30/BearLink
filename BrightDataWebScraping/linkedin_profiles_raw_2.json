He asked excellent questions, focused on learning the domain and how to work with them team, and was extremely successful. Derek's attitude and way of approaching work fit very well at Gusto, and he delivered his project on time. We have already begun feeling the impact of that work, with improvements to our flows and a reduction in effort for a related team. I very much enjoyed working with Derek and I know he will be successful at whatever software company is lucky enough to hire him after college.”"

He had a good attitude and was willing to work on variety of tasks using C++, CUDA, PHP, MySQL, and Python to help our team collected crucial performance data. It was a pleasure interacting with him this summer. Scott will make a great addition to any team.”",
            "Kevin Acken “Scott worked as a software intern at our company, The OhZone, during the summer of 2019. During his internship, Scott impressed us with his ability to quickly learn and improve upon advanced algorithms and data structures, ability to calculate and compare algorithmic performance optimizations (C++), his willingness and ability to delve into new areas (backend web server, PhP, MySQL), and his effectiveness working both independently and in a team environment. Example tasks that Scott worked on include: (1) stepping through and learning multiple large C++ software packages, adding new optimizations, and completing quality/performance experiments; (2) running output quality experiments based on varying algorithm parameters; (3) co-programmed statistics tabulating web pages using PHP and pulling and manipulating data using MySQL; (4) learning CUDA in an effort to improve program performance. It was a pleasure having Scott work for The OhZone, and we highly recommend him for any future opportunities in technology companies.”"

        "about": "A Computer Science Graduate dedicated to pushing the capabilities of computer science. \n\nMy experiences range throughout all aspects of computer science. I have a particular interest for Machine Learning based applications through my past internship experience at companies like Quantiphi working on Computer Vision Software or my recent experiences with Large Language Models through my current internship at Appsoc. Alongside work experience are the numerous classes I have taken in the field from the math behind machine learning to visualizing neural networks and unmasking the black box. I also have worked on a multitude of personal projects, designing playable opponents in my favorite Board Game Quoridor through reinforcement learning or using natural language processing to build a more secure security scanner.\n\nI am however committed to all aspects of Computer Science including past experiences in Blockchain Development through the start-up I co-founded in highschool and my experience with robotics work in the lab I am currently in. Not to mention my consistent drive to constantly  learn new technologies. This past summer and through this current Fall semester, I have the privilege of working at Appsoc, a cybersecurity firm designing DevOps software, granting me new experiences in a field I have not worked in before. With my most recent work experience at Realm Labs, I was able to work in a full stack environment working on a variety of different projects. I worked on high quality data connectors for Sharepoint, OneDrive, Confluence, and DataBricks used for RAG Chatbots. I built a frontend and backend testing suite that was used for 80% of our testing purposes. And worked on a variety of Data Governance and Interpretability tools to provide disclaimers and study the output of chatbots.\n\nMy commitment to Computer Science extends to helping others find that same passion and drive. As a current director for Cal Hacks, the largest collegiate Hackathon in the country, I can share my love by running the logistics and entertainment events to make the competition a success for all 2000 participants. Not to mention my tutoring experiences working in small class and one on one tutoring sessions to more directly educate others.",

One of the major and widespread usages of these robots is in the industrial businesses, where they are employed to carry massive loads in and around work areas. As these working environments might not be completely localized and could be dynamically changing, new approaches must be evaluated to guarantee a crash-free way of performing duties. This paper presents a new and efficient fusion algorithm for solving the path planning problem in a custom 2D environment. This fusion algorithm integrates an improved and optimized version of both, A* algorithm and the Artificial potential field method. Firstly, an initial or preliminary path is planned in the environmental model by adopting the A* algorithm. The heuristic function of this A* algorithm is optimized and improved according to the environmental model. This is followed by selecting and saving the key nodes in the initial path. Lastly, on the basis of these saved key nodes, path smoothing is done by artificial potential field method. Our simulation results carried out using Python viz. libraries indicate that the new fusion algorithm is feasible and superior in smoothness performance and can satisfy as a time-efficient and cheaper alternative to conventional A* strategies of path planning."

This belief that Model-based strategies that involve the use of welltrained neural networks for making such high-level decisions always give better performance can be dispelled by making use of Model-free policy search methods. This paper proposes the use of a model-free random searching strategy, called Augmented Random Search (ARS), which is a better and faster approach of linear policy training for continuous control tasks like controlling a Quadcopter’s flight. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by eliminating the use of too much data for the training of neural networks that are present in the previous approaches to the task of Quadcopter control. The paper also highlights the performance results of the searching strategy used for this task in a strategically designed task environment with the help of simulations. Reward collection performance over 1000 episodes and agent’s behavior in flight for augmented random search is compared with that of the behavior for reinforcement learning state-of- the-art algorithm, called Deep Deterministic policy gradient(DDPG) Our simulations and results manifest that a high variability in performance is observed in commonly used strategies for sample efficiency of such tasks but the built policy network of ARS-Quad can react relatively accurately to step response providing a better performing alternative to reinforcement learning strategies."

Details -Learning & development (L&D) is an important strategic factor for sustainable business growth of any organization. L&D has become an integral part of an organization, considering the fast-paced growth of industries. Success of learning and development program depends on how well it identifies the critical skill gaps in its workforce and bridges those gaps by considering individual learner's strengths and aspirations while recommending learning opportunities. Such recommendation requires a rich information about learners and learning opportunities. In this paper, we propose a framework that recommends learning opportunities to learners based on their preferences. We also propose a way to connect users of similar interests on the platform to improve course engagement. We developed a conversational AI agent that assist the learner in their journey. We evaluated our approach on the dataset consisting of 5,000 learners, and 49,202 courses. Our approach performed significantly better than the baseline approach."

In the last five years, my main focus has been real-time genomic analysis and data viz. My current focus is creating machine learning models to predict cancer drug response. \n\nI have worked as a software developer for 20+ years.  My first job was in Sacramento CA with Intel.  After that, I moved to Salt Lake City Utah.  My first dream job was working on the Human Genome Project in an academic lab at the University of Utah.  Here I could combine my love of biology with my love of software.  Once I got a taste of this, I never looked back.  I spent 10 years working at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, developing a laboratory management system and genomic data repository.  Four years ago, I  joined a computational biology lab at the University of Utah, working on real-time analysis (cloud-based) and web-based visualizations (D3).  This job challenges and rewards me in ways I never imagined.  I work on a multi-disciplinary team with a great group of people.  Working in the lab has allowed me to learn about many fascinating bioinformatics projects — problems that demand rigorous statistical approaches, innovative algorithms, and large-scale data processing.  \n\nI just completed my Master's degree in Data Science (MIDS) from UC Berkeley.",

She also went out of her way to introduce me to Raytheon’s social groups which helped me network with other professionals within our company. While working with Revan, I observed on several occasions her passion for programming and the challenges that come with it. In fact, she took the initiative to reach out to several project leads from other sites and request more work if and when available. Revan is not only a team player but leader as well. For example, she started the Raytheon’s Women Network in our office, which helps women in STEM network with other engineers and helps with career growth. Furthermore, Revan volunteers at colleges and is a mentor to students who want a career in STEM. ”"

My biggest challenge was loading the dataset as it is composed of over 70,000 black hole images in the M87 galaxy captured by the Event Horizon Telescope. However, with the mentorship of my professor and research mentor, I was able to create an accurate and precise model with a 0.01 mean squared error.

            "Pedro Monarrez “Anya has a strong interest in combining quantitative and coding skills with the environmental sciences and sustainability, and this is reflected in her professional aspirations. Anya has participated in various research programs for high schoolers to develop and enhance her coding and research skills that she plans to apply and further develop as a college student. These experiences include participating as an intern for CareFall Monitoring Entrepreneurship Project where she helped developed an affordable wearable device for the elderly that detects falls and send alerts. During her internship at Stanford, Anya and her team used the statistical language, R, to develop a machine-learning algorithm to help identify the most important predictors of extinction marine fossil animal groups in the fossil record. They would go on to present the results of their research at the 2022 American Geophysical Union Fall meeting. Given Anya's experience and interests in combining her coding and quantitative skills on environmental and sustainability efforts, and her drive and passions, she would have no problem accomplishing any goals and completing any challenge ahead of her.”",
            "Jayeeta Chowdhury “Anya Sengupta is a brilliant and exceptional young student. Her strength lies in her focus, diligence, going into depth, eye for details and ability to multi-task. She is compassionate and that helps her to conceive of ideas and projects around technology for better social and health outcomes. She is open to feedback, a fast learner, and able to connect complex factors in solving problems. Anya is an asset and as her mentor, it was a joy to guide her. It was enriching to engage with her and I learnt along the way. Above all, she is a fine human being. I highly recommend Anya for her quality of work, problem solving attitude, hard efforts and the equanimity she demonstrate during high pressure situations. A dynamic academic and entrepreneurial environment will bring out the best in her and shape her extremely well for the future. I wish Anya success and joy in her future endeavours.”"

                "description": "The industrial, transportation, and residential sectors draw the most energy in the United States. With most energy created by burning fossil fuels, a highly inefficient method of energy creation, global greenhouse gas levels are rising, raising the temperature of the earth, causing natural processes to become unbalanced. The health of the earth is declining. The rise of technology and persisting growth of computing devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT) and increasing automation of systems through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is a factor of energy expenditure as more humans desire devices and more systems are built. The ethical implications of utilizing new technology should be evaluated before creating more. This paper explores modern computing systems in the sectors that draw the most energy, and, more specifically, the role AI and IoT play in them. Each sector may become more energy efficient, productive, and safer by introducing edge computing through IoT devices and coupling it with AI computing abilities that already automate most processes. Multiple studies show energy consumption and costs are lowered when edge computing is paired with the IoT and AI. There is less human involvement, more regularity in execution and performance, and more widespread use because of the accessibility. This creates safer, cheaper, energy-efficient systems that utilize existing technology. The ethical implications of these systems are much more positive than what already exists. Coupling the power of AI with the IoT will reduce energy expenditure in modern systems and create a more sustainable world."

Informed by our work supporting pilots of these audits in several California counties, we identify gaps in current technology in tools for this task: we need better ways to count voted ballots (from scanned images) without access to scans of blank, unmarked ballots; and we need improvements to existing techniques that help them scale better to large, complex elections. We show how to meet these needs and use our system to successfully process ballots from 11 California counties, in support of the pilot audit program. Our new techniques yield order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the previous system, and enable us to successfully process some elections that would not have reasonably feasible without these techniques."

In reality, it's my curiosity and drive to break things down and truly understand how they work that have consistently fueled my growth as an engineer.\n\nOutside of work, I'm proud to be an engineering expert to some volunteer organizations developing very cool tech to support Ukraine.",

When Aaron told me a few years ago that he wanted to eventually leave the teaching profession and pursue a career in web development, I told him it could be a great career move and that it was certainly something he needed to try. His completion of the Lambda certification in Full Stack Web Development and the portfolio of projects he put together over a short period of time, while working as a teacher, is a testimony to his willingness to work hard and his ability to quickly learn new technical skills.”"

Amos was a quick learner and displayed excellent communication and collaboration skills. What sets him apart is his strong analytical thinking and curiosity. I was impressed with how he always takes the initiative to go above and beyond tasks. He eagerly took on new challenges, and sought opportunities for himself to expand his skillset and to learn new technologies. I have no doubt that Amos will be a valuable asset to any team. His passion for continuous learning, problem-solving prowess, and dedication to excellence makes him an exceptional candidate for a software engineer. I am confident that he will thrive in a dynamic and challenging environment, bringing fresh perspectives and making meaningful contributions to any project he's involved in.”"

                "description": "In our introductory computer science course at a large public university, we embarked on a transformative journey inspired by Grading for Equity. Our goal: to accommodate differential learning, allowing students to attain a fixed level of mastery, albeit over a variable timeframe.Our course has six major project assessments that comprise 46% of the overall grade. In Fall 2022 (n=234), despite warnings, we allowed indefinite extensions on projects and observed a drastic downturn in project completion rates relative to previous terms.The Spring 2023 iteration (n=107) aimed to rectify this. Students could acquire two-week (or a single emergency one month) extensions. Further extensions obligated a student-staff interaction during dedicated support hours. Completion rates and lateness improved compared to fall, but were still poor compared to historical data. We also observed heightened stress.Summer 2023 (n=59) presented unique challenges: a smaller cohort, different demographics, and a halved timeframe. Nonetheless, we further refined our approach: 72-hour extensions were auto-approved, with additional time warranting a conversation with staff. Further, we mandated attendance to ensure students stay on-pace with material. The outcomes were stellar: near-perfect project completion rates, reduced lateness, and rejuvenated student sentiments. Fall 2023 (n=214) was our testbed for this strategy in a standard term, and early results showcase markedly better metrics compared to Fall 2022 and Spring 2023.In conclusion, while embracing a flexible, mastery-learning approach is vital to accommodate differential learning, finding a judicious equilibrium between autonomy and structure can be pivotal in navigating academic outcomes and student well-being."

I saw, in-person no less, how passionately she takes her personal growth when she took part in an optional lab we offer, learning to code in Node-RED, a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways, where she build a localized weather dashboard using The Weather Channel API. The same passion shone through when she engaged in other activities in the program, whether it was working for 3-months with another team in IBM building an AI based solution for identity threat detection and response, being part of a Drone Lab team (agile development, iterative programming, pair programming, agile story management, managing GitHub repos etc.) which coded drones to do acrobatics, or being part of a four-person team working on their first Patent Disclosure. No matter what the task, she arrived prepared, and enthusiastic, and had a positive impact on the teams she worked with. I highly recommend Raya!” Show less",
            "“I started working with Raya in 2022 when she offered to take over the admin for some security compliance issues I was dealing with. Such an offer is rare (who wants to do paperwork right?) but Raya just saw something important that wasn't being done as it should be, and did it properly. This exemplifies my experience working with her since then; Raya is smart, driven and willing to get down and do what needs to be done (even if it's tedious!). She is sharp and learns quickly, picking up technology with a speed that astounds; more importantly, Raya has become someone that I trust to always \"do the right thing\" with security issues, and that is something that I do not say of many. My experience of working with Raya has been extremely positive and I thoroughly recommend her.” Show less"

However, I have been running linux and fooling around with code for 10 years, so I have picked up a lot of miscellaneous knowledge, and would be capable of writing most languages in most positions. My favorite languages are Julia, Haskell, and Rust, and I run emacs with vim keybindings; I think that should tell you a good amount about me.\n\nOn the math side, I mainly studied category-theory adjacent fields in my bachelors (graduate classes in Algebra, Algebraic Topology, and Algebraic Geometry), and I did my bachelor's thesis on Applied Category Theory. In my master's I'm working on the applied side, so I'm studying probability and statistics. I hope to bring these two fields together in future research.",

The first was the hidden recording system, which was automatically initiated with the operating system. This system recorded all phone calls using the computer's sound card and a specific capture device connected to both the sound card and the telephone line.The second system was a management tool, allowing a supervisory user to review and listen to the recorded calls. This functionality was available both on the machine where the calls were recorded and from any other machine on the same network.The software was equipped with several unique features, such as DTMF detection through sound waves and the ability to save recordings in MP3 format. It also provided detailed call logs including duration, date, and time, and offered the functionality to add notes to each recording. This was particularly useful in a call center environment where operators could record details related to each finished call.The recording system was developed using Delphi 2007, while the management tool utilized AspNet. Both systems were built upon an MSSQL database. Looking back, I take great pride in having contributed to this vital tool which significantly enhanced telecommunications management and record-keeping practices.The main challenges here was processing the wave form sinals and extract all the information needed, also optimize the sound quality to use the best compression as possible without losing quality."

I recently completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence from Cambridge and a Bachelor of Science in computer science with a minor in math from William & Mary. After creating my first rock, paper, scissors app in 7th grade, I never looked back and devoted my high school and college career to taking as many computer science classes as possible and creating outside opportunities to make even more apps, websites, and scripts. Outside of coding, I enjoy rowing/coxing, cooking, sewing, improv comedy, and drinking as many chai lattes as possible.",

        "about": "When I was little, the internet was still an unknown and burgeoning realm of possibilities. MySpace was the most popular form of social media, and Neopets was one of the biggest games out there. As soon as I was old enough to play on my parents' laptops, I was enthralled, amazed, and overall plainly terrified of the internet. It was a big-wide world inside such a tiny machine, and it was beautiful but so intimidating. Of course, as a computer technician and the owner of a cloud-hosting business, my father swiftly taught me as much as he had time to, and as much as an eight-year-old who only wanted to play Cool Math Games could stand to learn.\n\nIn retrospect, if I told my younger self that I would be a software engineer and that I would be a part of the people who made the internet a more interesting place to be, I definitely wouldn't have believed it (I mean, it's just so cool!). And I certainly wouldn't have believed that I became a part of various projects, such as a machine learning lab that uses software to develop machine learning solutions, or that I coauthored a research paper on software development and Agile, or that I'm now working for a company that makes software for event-based companies, but I have! And I like to think that the younger me would be proud of that.\n\nMy goal is to continually develop my skillset in new and sometimes serendipitous ways to make a true and good impact in the world. I hope to continue my education in graduate school to continue to bring these new skills back to my future employer.",

            "Daniel Lopez “Sri is a very talented young engineer whom any would greatly benefit from having on their team. He’s very intelligent, extremely teachable and just a pleasure to work with. During his internship, he helped me not only deliver units of work but supported my vision in setting and enforcing strong programming patterns throughout the organization. Sri has a promising career ahead of him and I urge anybody who is considering hiring him to not pass up on probably one of the best new grad engineers in the field at the moment.”"

            "Ashwin Poojary “Megan Du interned in the Ubiquitous Streaming Platform Services SRE team which manages all the Apache Kafka and other Pub-Sub services at Twitter. Specifically, she did a fantastic job on creating a complex service to increase the flexibility in triggering any event, and executing different actions based on webhooks. This reduced the delay in remediation of alerts through automation. This includes design, documentation, coding, implementation, testing and deployment of the service with her mentors. This required the knowledge of Python and Go languages as well as conceptual understanding of webhooks and how large scale production services work. She demonstrated a pattern of high productivity, quick learning ability, excellent technical skills, problem solving ability, technical aptitude, critical thinking, teamwork, giving and taking feedback and exceptional work ethics. I would highly recommend that Megan would be an asset to any organization!”"

Gained 150,000+ impressions post-launch, 12,000+ profile visits, & 100+ Bot uses winning us the award of Most Impactful Team in the Uber Global Hackathon, and is a project that is continuously worked on. DetectBot is based on the ManTraNet. It uses a TensorFlow backend, with Keras serving as a high-level neural network library, making it user-friendly. It uses two sub-networks: an Image Manipulation Trace Feature Extractor, which is sensitive to different manipulation techniques and encodes the location of image manipulation into a fixed dimension feature vector, and a Local Anomaly Detection Network, which compares the dominant feature averaged from a local region to a local feature, indicating signs of image manipulation based on the deviation from the reference feature. It has been hosted in an AWS Cloud Server, with an open-source on GitHub."

I saw this firsthand when I managed Angie while she worked on the NLP team developing conversational AI at McD TechLabs and IBM Watson Orders. Angie was an integral contributor to our project. Her commitment to rigor and her attention to detail raised the quality of the entire team's work. In addition to her technical contributions, she was a tremendous teammate who fostered a collaborative work environment. I'll always appreciate Angie's steady optimism and ability to get others excited about whatever problem we were trying to solve. I strongly recommend Angie, and any company would be lucky to have her join their team!”",

Approachable and kind, she could articulately answer any question, quickly incorporate new information, and refute others gracefully. She was the glue that held everything together. She was always helping others, building and advocating for her ideas, and doing important work that had to be done. On top of all this, she has been able to complete her Master’s degree and finish a web dev bootcamp.. all while performing excellently at her full-time job.

            "Esteban Ordoñez “I had the privilege of working closely with Frances during their tenure as a lead instructor at Fullstack Academy, where I served as a Mentor. Frances was responsible for guiding a diverse cohort of over 30 students through an intensive fullstack web development curriculum, which included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, and essential tech interviewing skills. Frances's approach to instruction was truly commendable. They consistently demonstrated an exceptional level of empathy and patience when working one-on-one with students, many of whom came from nontraditional backgrounds and were transitioning from roles at companies like Amazon. Their ability to connect with each student on a personal level fostered an environment of trust and collaboration within the classroom. What stood out to me most about Frances was their unwavering positivity and their willingness to go above and beyond to support their colleagues and students alike. They approached every challenge with a solution-oriented mindset and were always eager to share their extensive knowledge and expertise in software engineering. I wholeheartedly endorse Frances for any software engineering position. Their combination of technical proficiency, interpersonal skills, and genuine passion for education make them an invaluable asset to any team. Frances's dedication to empowering others and their natural ability to inspire those around them make them a standout candidate in the field of software engineering. It was truly a pleasure to work alongside Frances, and I have no doubt that they will continue to excel in their future endeavors.”",
            "Glenda R. “Through shared connections, I heard of Frances as a leader in software engineering promoting females and diversity in tech. I’m a seasoned developer, with a similar background, re-entering the field. So, when I noticed that she was offering mentoring calls, I immediately signed up. During our time, Frances provided valuable insights into current hiring processes. She shared excellent tips for crafting a resume and updating my LinkedIn profile. Additionally, she provided resources for further education and job postings. Frances’ knowledge is both focused and wide-reaching, following the current market trends. She was also very supportive and encouraged me to regain my confidence to grow in my career path. I highly recommend Frances to anyone looking for a mentor.”"

This can lead to higher doctor turnover or result in the decrease of quality of care of a patient. Utilizing stochastic appointment scheduling optimization, our team created improved schedules to balance the tradeoff between customer and doctor satisfaction. We employed the simulation software Simio to assess the current processes in the Endocrinology center, including what occurs during patient-doctor interaction. The center had difficulty quantifying how much time was spent between when the doctor should have seen a patient and when they actually saw a patient. By applying the new schedules and approaching the problem with a genetic algorithm and simulation, we were able to accomplish reduced waiting times and improved quality of care."

All women at Georgia Tech who hold over a 3.0 GPA are invited to attend and a select few are awarded scholarships from companies. To benefit students, faculty, and companies, students must be seated with companies or faculty that correspond to their majors. In addition, companies have requirements based on GPA and Citizenship which must be met. In previous years, this was done manually and took about 3 weeks to seat all attendees. Any changes to the list of RSVPs had to be handled manually as well. I wrote a seating algorithm which takes in all of the requirements of attendees from Excel files and outputs a seating plan in a matter of minutes."

There are also important lessons and personal qualities, which one learns and develops through an integrated program of academic and extracurricular education. The founders of ODK formulated the idea that leadership of exceptional quality and versatility in college should be recognized, that representatives in all phases of college life should cooperate in a worthwhile endeavor, and that outstanding students, faculty, and administration members should meet on a basis of mutual interest, understanding, and helpfulness.",

I love using the tools I've gained, such as Python, Java, C, C#, Javascript, and a grasp of data structures and algorithms--to find creative ways to solve issues presented. I believe human creativity is what makes all our work special. Aside from CS related things, I love to rock climb, play guitar, play badminton, do digital art/animation, and learn new languages!\n\nI'd love to get to know you more, so feel free to reach out!\nkaseyliu.business@gmail.com",

            "Matthew Lin “Kasey stands out as one of the most hard-working and kind software engineers I have had the pleasure to know. Her accomplishments extend well beyond the foundational computer science projects that computer science students typically undertake. Over the past year, she has devoted countless hours to learning and applying her knowledge, gaining invaluable experience across a spectrum of organizations and internships as well as investing considerable time and effort volunteering with Hack For Impact, a charitable organization that offers software development expertise to non-profits. She doesn't merely focus on personal gains; rather, she leaves a lasting impact wherever she goes, embodying a genuine commitment to both personal growth and transforming the world around her into a better place. I wholeheartedly recommend her for any role, confident that any team or organization would greatly benefit from her contributions.”",

As the semester went on, I enjoyed the class, I found it fun to make small programs that I could visually see execute (even as simple as multiplying and printing a number to the terminal). Once I began registering for my next semesters classes, I realized that I was bummed out I wouldn’t be taking another coding class, so I did what any person would do. Changed my major to Computer Science and began taking classes I enjoyed.\n\nFast forward to now, I am working at Netflix.

Fluent in languages such as Python, C++, and JavaScript, I bring both adaptability and depth to my coding endeavors.\n\nAt UCSC's Humanities Computing Services, I dedicated over two years to tech support, exemplifying a blend of technical proficiency, organizational skills, and clear communication. As the lead technician for the Apple repair program, I oversaw the diagnosis and repair of 100+ Apple devices, streamlined technician training, pioneered process documentation, and established an informational website for team continuity. My efforts further extended to enrolling and deploying computing systems for the Humanities division, emphasizing my commitment to operational optimization.\n\nMy portfolio also boasts web development projects like designing an intuitive website to locate capybaras and implementing key features in an asset management system. From configuring LEDs for Morse code transmission to developing a 6ft tracker for COVID-19 safety using OpenCV, my projects underline my passion for blending software with real-world utility.\n\nAs I venture into the next chapter, I'm keen to embrace roles in software or fullstack development, employing my skills and soaking in insights from industry veterans. With a foundation that spans technical support, software development, and personal projects, I am poised to contribute to, and grow within, the dynamic landscape of tech.",

            "Kim Hwe “I had the pleasure of supervising Steven in his role as an IT Support Technician for the Humanities Division at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He joined our team in 2021, a pivotal year for us as we transitioned to a hybrid work model. Steven's ability to adapt quickly and his eagerness to contribute were apparent from the start. In the midst of this transition to the \"new normal\", Steven's willingness to assist, rapid learning, and collaborative nature were invaluable. He helped set up a number of DTEN teleconferencing units on his first day, efficiently handled support tickets in ServiceNow, and provided both in-person and remote support for over 350 faculty and 50 staff members. Additionally, Steven served as an Apple repair technician for our campus repair program, ensuring faculty members across the UC Santa Cruz campus had fully functioning Mac laptops. What truly stood out was Steven's unwavering commitment to providing outstanding customer service. He approached every interaction with kindness and a genuine desire to leave a positive impression. Steven's unique combination of approachability, willingness to lend a hand, and technical proficiency make him a standout team member. I have no doubt that he will excel in any role he takes on. It is with genuine enthusiasm that I recommend Steven to any organization fortunate enough to bring him on board.”"
