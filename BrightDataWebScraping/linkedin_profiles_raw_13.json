        "about": "I have worked in education and neurodiversity for almost 20 years, and my passion is to support businesses and organizations, parents, and other educators in understanding neurodivergence (ADHD, dyslexia, Autism) in children and adults and learning how to create environments that better support all kinds of minds. I write for multiple publications, and for my own newsletter, on neurodiversity, parenting, and my experience with my own ADHD. I guide parents in navigating supports and choices around their neurodivergent children. I blend expertise and lived experience with curiosity and humor.",

I aim to leverage my analytical skills to contribute to a dynamic team environment, fostering innovation and continuous improvement.\n\nBeyond my professional aspirations, I am dedicated to giving back to the community that shaped me. I hope to work with students from similar backgrounds, collaborating with school districts and administration to create opportunities and support systems that promote educational success in Los Angeles schools.\n\nI am seeking opportunities that will allow me to grow both personally and professionally while making a tangible difference in the communities I serve.",

            "Jaclyn Fidler “I met Jason through Scott Leese's Patreon group. He was a guest speaker and I was, well, skeptical. Having been in sales all my life, I wasn't accustomed to focusing on my breath. I was focused on caffeine, multi-tasking, and a fast-paced lifestyle. My first call with Jason was met with apprehension and resistance, my second call was met with gratitude and clarity. He was patient with me, followed up with me, and above all - opened up my mind. Jason is a wealth of knowledge and speaks from experience and from his heart. I'm so thankful he stuck with me at times when I was set in my ways. If you're in search of personal development, especially as you navigate through life in this VUCA world, call him. In return, you’ll learn how to respond rather than react.”",
            "Todd Corbin “Jason is a gifted mindfulness facilitator and basketball coach, part of the reason being that he is incredibly thoughtful, grounded, and insightful. Jason also has amazing ability to quickly integrate new things he learns into his life and coaching. I got to know Jason from taking my 7-week Mindfulness for Student Athletes online course for sports coaches, educators, parents, and professionals. Jason coaches AAU basketball and junior college teams. It quickly became clear to myself and the class just how much wisdom Jason has gathered while coaching. When he spoke everyone listened intently. His words are carefully chosen and powerful. I asked Jason if he'd share his unique insights with the rest of the participants during one of the weekly class sessions. He prepared a 30 minute segment on the intersection between competition and mindfulness using the Michael Jordan documentary as a focal point. Jason started everyone off with a mindfulness practice that allowed all of us to reflect on some deep and thoughtful questions. All of the dozen plus participants loved the topic but more so, his wisdom and ability to make the content really come alive. I would not hesitate to ask Jason again to lead another segment for a future my class. Everyone comes away richer from his insight. ”"

Across the 110 students who took the class, the average screen time reduction was 3.5 hours per day.\n\nProject Reboot is my effort to bring that course to a broader audience. Through speaking, consulting, and facilitating guided digital detox programs in schools, I have helped over 5,000 teens build better tech habits.\n\nPlease shoot me a message if you are interested in bringing Project Reboot to your community or working with me directly!",

I'm Angelique, a UC Berkeley Haas School of Business graduate with experience spanning management consulting, product development, growth marketing, and strategy & operations, with a strong emphasis on cross-functional collaboration to solve complex business problems.\n\n🌍 Growing up in France and moving to California has given me a global perspective and the ability to thrive in diverse, dynamic environments. Whether it's leading teams to execute marketing strategies, improving user experiences through data analysis, or collaborating across departments to enhance product features, I’m always eager to tackle new challenges.\n\n📊 With experiences in various industries, I love diving deep into projects that require analytical thinking and creative solutions. My goal is to bridge the gap between business strategy and technology, and I’m constantly seeking opportunities to make an impact.\n\n🏃‍♀️ Outside of work, I'm an adventurer at heart. From snowboarding and climbing to setting my sights on archery and golfing, I’m always exploring new activities that keep me motivated and curious.\n\nFor any inquiries, please reach out to me through e-mail: angeliquezoile@gmail.com. I'd be happy to continue chatting about our common interests, professional goals, or whatever else may be on your mind.",

Using data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and Financial Times, I created a regression analysis that compared the rate of increase in COVID cases to the strictness of the lockdown at given points in time. This statistical comparison aimed to see how effective lockdowns were in mitigating COVID cases at given points in time. I evaluated six countries, one from each of the six continents, finding that countries that implemented lockdown restrictions earlier in the pandemic had 50% lower cases of COVID compared to countries that did not lockdown earlier. In other words, my analysis showed that the timing of when a lockdown was imposed dramatically affects how well cases are mitigated versus the strictness of the lockdown.

My recent role as a Project Consultant at IDEA Factory Consulting entailed developing outreach strategies and a successful conversion rate. In parallel, my position as Social Chair strengthened my event planning and financial oversight capabilities, ensuring memorable experiences for over 30 members.\n\nOur team's efforts in competitive analysis and marketing strategies yielded insightful entry points into the Gen-Z market for our clients. We fostered a culture of engagement and innovation, where I learned that active participation drives community involvement. Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage these experiences to contribute to an organization's growth, aligning with its values and enriching its culture with diverse perspectives.",

We work with instructors from across campus to develop open-source interactive curriculum that is deployed on a cloud-based campus server.  Two of our flagship programs are Data Science Connectors, two-unit domain seminars to accompany the Data-8 class, and Data Science Modules, that introduce Data Science into existing courses.  I also facilitate summer workshops teaching our faculty, and instructors from across the country,  to use data science pedagogy in their classes . \n\nIn Fall 2017, I developed a class teaching international development through the tools of the Data 8 Intro to Data Science course at Berkeley, and I got hooked!  In Spring 2019 I taught an undergraduate Data Science Connector course on Reproducibility and Open Science, and went on to work with a student team in developing another one on Economic Modeling for Fall 2019, that is still being taught.   \n \nI have worked the areas of applied economics analysis of international and environmental issues in a variety of system and settings. I have always had an interest in how socially focussed research can benefit society and have worked on a variety of issues of political importance but in a micro- applied research setting. I am now working on the vision on how to get students to learn through hands-on experiences in reproducibility, interactive computing, and research exposure.  \n\n",

Recently I joined several of my favorite faculty members to launch a new program called the Master of Computational Social Science, which teaches students to use data science tools for social good. \n \nIn my career at UC Berkeley I've learned from researchers, educators, journalists, a business leaders. I'm lucky to be working with the best data scientists and machine learning experts in the world.  My colleagues and students have given me a front seat to the most recent developments and reveal compelling stories of innovation and perseverance.  \n\nI enjoy connecting people.  I enjoy watching ideas and dreams come true — and after traveling to 60+ countries, I'm pretty sure Berkeley is the best place on the planet for this!  \n\nI'm an international traveler, published author, and local history buff.  My heroes are the people who make us pause, think, and set out to be better.  My book, Berkeley Guidebook: Adventures at the Vortex of Ideas and Audacity, is available online and at bookstores.  It's about the history and unsung heroes of Berkeley's past (with a few villains too!) based on the original research I did for my walking tours.  If you'd like a tour, you can book me through Airbnb.",

                "description": "This paper describes a recently developed software called ``TGL-Lambda'' enables quantifying lure attractiveness under a variety of field capture scenarios including mixed lure/trap combinations. TGL-Lambda delivers a flexible approach to simultaneously estimating the \"lambda\" value for multiple trap types, accommodating a common situation in ``Mark-release-recapture'' (MRR) experiments in the field. Specifically, where researchers release a known number of marked insects in a field and count how many are recaptured in two to five trap and lure types, and the trap and release locations are known, TGL-Lambda can be used to estimate the attractiveness (lambda) of each of the trap types."

                "description": "While working at the USDA, I noticed that we could use an easier way to calculate the attractiveness level of a lure, which we call 1/λ (the distance in which the probability of the lure succeeding is 65%). I also saw that a huge problem we faced is that when we were given experiments that involved multiple types of lures, there are far too many different possible combinations of attractiveness for the lures.To solve these problems, I created an updated version of our java software known as \"TrapGrid\". My program, called \"TGL Lambda\" is in Python and it essentially allows the user to input their experiment, including the number of traps and different lures used, the locations of these traps, and their recorded recapture rate, and it calculates the possible levels of trap attractiveness for each of the lures used. It uses Latin Hypercube Sampling to find a smaller number of combinations that should still display the area of the specific ones which we believe, after complex mathematical equations and calculations, could have led to the user's recapture rate. TGL Lambda is now available on GitHub, and its research paper is available on arXiv.https://github.com/benscalero/TG-Laboratory/tree/main/TGL-Lambdahttps://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05408"

Our collaborations on various assignments and discussions consistently showcased her ability to communicate ideas with clarity and engage in effective brainstorming. During our Statics course, she solve the problem really quick during our group discussion. During our final project for Machine Learning course, Daisy possesses robust coding abilities and a deep understanding of data science principles. Additionally, her exceptional presentation skills were particularly evident during our final project showcase.”",
            "Panyarak Roque “It was a joy to work with Daisy at Wedu, where she was Senior Leadership Development Coordinator. In the almost years that I worked with her, I have admired Daisy’s incredible work ethic, genuine commitment, and inspiring passion for women’s leadership development. She brought not only the analytical rigor to any team discussion or project, but also her values and well-rounded perspectives that often re-clarified what was meaningful and impactful for the individual women leaders whom we served. She nurtured a safe space in teams that enabled strong collaboration and personal growth, while managing to be firm in her views without alienating others who may disagree. She was one of the most compassionate colleagues I have ever had. I am proud to call her a friend. Any team will be lucky to have her. ”"

He was always dependable and would never hesitate to go the extra mile to make his work better. I plan to do research again with him in the future, as I know I can always count on him to produce excellence on whatever he works on. Outside of that, Zach has shown time and time again his genuine kindness towards others and altruism throughout the years that I’ve known him. He is one of the hardest workers I know and, more importantly, a phenomenal person to be around in general.”"

My high interest in data science has led me to pursue projects and experiences that can aid the impaired through adaptive technology, such as the Overhead Movement Alarm Radar, a prototype I and several others have developed in order to assist visually impaired individuals in preemptively detecting overhead obstacles.\n\nIn order to further my ability to work in data science, I have gained a foundational understanding of various topics, including adversarial machine learning, machine learning robustness, and AI safety. In particular, I am extremely passionate about adversarial machine learning, and am hoping to pursue research involving making classifiers more robust to adversaries. In my volunteer work, I have mentored younger students in mathematics and programming with my experience from AIME and USACO Platinum and hosted data science seminars.\n \nI am eager to connect with other like-minded individuals and professionals who share my passion for data science and innovation. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions, or just want to hold a conversation.",

        "about": "Hello! My name is Asbah, and I am from the Bay Area. I am studying Cognitive Science, Data Science, and Design Innovation at UC Berkeley. Through my majors and the courses I have taken, I have gained experience and connected human cognition, user data, research, and design to produce engaging, inclusive, and positive experiences. I am passionate about solving real world problems by integrating human cognition, data, and design, to ultimately create optimal experiences. \n\nMy love for design first spurred when I took Interior Design in high school. I remember learning about the principles of design for the first time. Having taken the design that surrounded me for granted before this, my eyes opened to small details I hadn't ever noticed before. I became excited for the endless doors of opportunities that opened because of this. I competed at the Regionals FCCLA Competition in February 2020, where I applied my newly acquired skills to design my client's home. There, I won first place and advanced on to win first place at the State level.  \n\nWhen I came to UC Berkeley, I hadn't completely decided what I wanted to study. After learning about human-computer interactions in my Introduction to Cognitive Science course, my interest in UX began. I value user feedback and believe that one of the most crucial components to a website, app, or product is understanding how the user interacts with it. After all, without the user, there is no product. \n\nMy interests in research, human cognition, and design have prompted me to study Data Science, Cognitive Science, and Design Innovation at UC Berkeley. By taking courses in these fields, I have realized how perfectly they work together. Without collecting and understanding user data, it is difficult to truly understand the user and their experiences. Failing to understand the user prevents the creation of optimal design. I hope to use my skills in data science, cognitive science, and design to organize and interpret user feedback to ultimately create effective experiences.  \n\nLiving in this day and age, there are numerous problems that face us today, and there is need for significant global change. Specifically concerned about the rise in crime, the environment, and inclusive education, I am passionate about applying my skills in design, research, and data science to design innovative experiences and solutions. In doing so, I hope to do my part as a changemaker for tomorrow's future.\n\nFeel free to connect with me and check out my website at https://asbahwasim.wixsite.com/asbah-wasim.

His knack for whipping up MVPs and dashboards at lightning speed left me in awe. And the questions he asks? Mind-blowing! They really make you think and dig deep. But it's not just about work; Christian's fun to be around, always wearing a smile and ready to lend a hand. He's got his stuff sorted out, and it shows. Seriously, he's a top-tier teammate and a great person to bounce ideas off. Lucky to have crossed paths with him!”"

Shirley is an effective team player who is diligent to ensure that they understand their individual tasks and how they fit within projects and connect to the work of their colleagues. Shirley is respectful and thoughtful, contributing positively to team culture and atmosphere. Shirley asks clear questions, offers well-considered ideas, and is an active participant in brain-storming, problem-solving, and action-planning. In addition, Shirley is able to work independently to find answers to problems that arise in their work, taking steps to explore how colleagues and peers have overcome similar problems, and working to implement strategies to eliminate process and programmatic barriers toward long-term solutions. I would be happy to work with Shirley again in the future and I am confident that Shirley would be a valuable addition to any team or project.”"

Given the Work-From-Home situation in this pandemic, it was hard to ramp up quickly and be effective, but Ada impressed us with how she made progress. Her knowledge about core Data Science concepts and skills, handling of Big Data in an extremely privacy compliant way, as well as finding the right applications of Data Science techniques was very impressive. She demonstrated supreme work ethics and was exemplary growth mindset in how she took feedback, used that to learn and grow. She will be an asset to any Data Science team in the industry.”",

I am looking for entry level data analyst roles and am open to different industries in order to gain real world experience. \nI have previously worked in education for 7 years. I'm passionate about working with students with learning differences and disabilities. My main hobby is reading; I read over 100 books a year. I also enjoy crocheting, watercolor painting, and going to concerts.\n\nYou can take a look at the projects I completed while at Berkeley in my Github Repository: https://github.berkeley.edu/andrea-padilla/projects",

I can say from firsthand experience, this support inspires those he manages to be better and to do their best work possible to accomplish any task at hand. I have met less than a handful of people who are capable of getting this standard of results from an entire team that they manage and Chris Schad is one of them.”",
            "Dr. June Blalock Furr “Chris Schad is one of the most hard working and innovative individuals that I have ever had the opportunity to work with. He sets goals and he reaches them. Chris Schad possesses the rare and unique ability to establish and maintain business relationships that are vital to success. I have worked with Chris over the past year as a Regional Coordinator in The Pearson Campus Ambassador Program, and I have often been not only impressed but inspired to pursue effective best practices that Chris demonstrates on a weekly basis! Schad's many successes are a matter of record at Pearson Students, and he is a an extremely effective leader with a results based track record, and would be a key member of any team that is lucky enough to have him.”"

To explore these ideas, I pursued dual degrees in Data Science and Psychology, graduating with Highest Honors from UC Berkeley.\n\nI currently work as a full-time Research Study Coordinator/Lab Manager in the University of Chicago's Memory Research Lab. In our lab, we use research tools from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to explore cognitive aging and identify the mechanisms that drive memory accuracy and distortion in different contexts. My role involves programming computerized cognitive tasks using JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Python, recruiting and testing research participants, training and coordinating research assistants,  and managing IRB protocols and grant funding.\n\nDuring my time at UC Berkeley, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Computational Psychiatry and Affective Cognitive Neuroscience Lab under Professor Sonia Bishop, where I conducted research on how limited sleep impacts the interplay between anxiety, depression, and decision-making. I also completed my Senior Honors Thesis under Professor Iris Mauss in the Emotion and Emotion Regulation lab, exploring ethnic variation in emotion judgments and their implications for psychological health.",

        "about": "One of my childhood dreams was to be a polyglot. Learning English in a very small town in the southeast of Bolivia was so much fun but not conducive to the pursuit. As I learned this new language, I familiarized myself with computers and realized I could learn multiple programming languages. An opportunity presented itself and I made one of the biggest decisions in my life - moving abroad to the States. \n\nBeing a wife and mother is part of my identity but that is not all I wanted to be. So, I decided to go back to school and obtained a B.S. in Computer Science. One of the projects I enjoyed the most during undergrad was focused on predictive analytics, specifically how to understand customer behavior by using unsupervised machine learning algorithms.  My research was centered on customer segmentation and the K-Means algorithm. \n\nThis experience sparked my interest in machine learning models and their role in supporting data-driven decision-making. Having gained more awareness of my interests and improved my communication, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, I decided to pursue a masters in Data Science. This role has been helping me learn to develop and expand personal aptitudes such as analytical, management, and data analytics skills.  My goal is to become a machine learning engineer.\n\nMy foremost strength is perseverance. I lived through economic hardships and limited opportunities which taught me to go the extra mile when an opportunity appears. I feel happy and productive, while at work. Time is very precious to me but it passes like a bullet-train when enjoying family, playing basketball or pickleball, walking, hiking or traveling.  I also find coding to solve a problem a thrill all on its own. If something catches my interest, motivation surges and I jump into action.\n\nPlease, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I would love to receive tips that could help me land my dream job in the field of machine learning. Also, I’m always looking forward to a conversation about animals, or the NBA.",

        "position": "Comprehensive College Planning at Options Abound Educational Consulting LLC",
        "about": " I come to the work of college planning from a strong background in clinical social work.  My graduate degree, professional experience, and practical parenting, have prepared me well to meet the needs of high school students and their families.  With years of counseling and advocacy experience, I comfortably navigate difficult conversations.  Particularly today, when many of our students are stressed and experiencing anxiety and depression, my clinical background offers a degree of expertise that de-stresses the entire college application journey.  A decade ago, in the thick of raising our four children, I helped parents troubleshoot when they found their students struggling in the typical classroom.  From assisting with college planning to homeschool curriculum advice, I partnered with families as they navigated the confusing landscape of educational options.   As my own children entered high school and I led them through college applications, I developed a love and passion for the work.   I returned to the classroom and completed the UC Irvine \"Certificate in Independent Educational Consultant\" coursework. Today, I am thrilled to be working as a Comprehensive College Planning IEC.   I work diligently to make the college application process smooth and joyful, removing some of the typical stresses associated with the college application journey.    In my work as an educational consultant, I readily serve as guide and facilitator and remove parent/guardian from the role of task manager.  I will walk the student through the entire process of finding a college match. Visiting and researching colleges throughout the United States enables me to work on optimal college fit.  I develop a timeline for the student, identify and coordinate testing and tutoring, assess student strengths and challenges, survey career options, discover their unique college fit, advise in college application completion, brainstorm and proofread essays, and educate on financial aid and merit aid.  I am passionate about getting students to tell their own story in a way that is engaging and powerful.   Reach out to me today to learn more about my services.",

        "about": "I began my career in education, working for three years as a Jumpstart AmeriCorps member in Oakland, CA, where I supported preschool-aged children in underserved communities. After the COVID-19 pandemic, I noticed a rise in language and fine motor skill delays among students and became increasingly aware of the systemic gaps in educational resources. This sparked my interest in exploring data-driven solutions beyond direct service.\n\nThis curiosity led me to research, and I joined UC Berkeley’s Language and Cognitive Development Lab, working on a COVID & Child-Directed Speech project analyzing how pandemic-related stressors affected caregiver-child interactions. Using R for linguistic analysis, I examined speech patterns and later developed my own ICBS-funded research project on how caregiver mood influenced affective language use.\n\nI later earned a B.A. in Psychology from UC Berkeley, where I combined my interests in human behavior and data analysis. Alongside research, I worked as an Intervention Specialist at Lincoln Families, applying data-driven intervention strategies to support students with developmental and learning disabilities. Tracking student progress through data collection and analysis reinforced my belief in the power of data to drive informed decision-making in education and social policy.\n\nNow, as a COOP fellow and a Master’s student in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley, I am refining my skills in Python, R, SQL, causal inference, and machine learning to analyze complex social issues. With a background in education, psychology, and research, I aim to leverage data science techniques to inform policy, improve educational interventions, and drive meaningful societal change.",

I am a career coach, community builder, program manager, and organization development practitioner. Working in edtech, academia, and consulting the past few years, the things that get me excited to wake up in the morning are:\n\n- Making data visualizations in order to make data-driven decisions (data viz nerd!) The data I love most usually involves looking at retention rates, satisfaction, happiness, or tracks back to diversity, inclusion or belonging. The best data insights come from using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data\n- Propelling a positive employee experience and high engagement end-to-end\n- Uplifting voices within teams and communities including providing strategy and structure to Employee Resource Group leads, organization design tactics, and programs that encourage collaboration on teams\n- Building out mentorships programs aimed at maintaining positive company culture, helping job seekers land their dream roles, or knowledge share \n- Planning and running complex career development programming for future coders, business world trailblazers, and career transitioners\n- Enacting strategic change or organizational transformation via change management strategies\n- Listening deeply and helping others harness their intuitive creativity \n- Planning and championing wellness programs/initiatives for employees \n- Recruiting and onboarding talent \n\nPlease reach out if you:\n--&gt; Are needing support, coaching, or mentorship in your job search\n--&gt; Are a talent development professional and want to share best practices for supporting the employee experience or job seekers\n\nOther things you might want to know about me:\n- I have a long term dream to start my own permaculture farm 🍎🥦🍉🥬 . It would make my day to talk with you about gardening, agriculture, permaculture, or sustainable farming practices. \n- I am a singer-writer and I've grown up in a family of musicians. Songwriting helps me process the world around me.\n- I do a lot of visual art (watercolor is my go-to medium right now)\n- I'll do anything sports related and can be pretty competitive about it (swimming, running, climbing, yoga, soccer, volleyball, to name a few)\n- I'm an Entertainer personality type ESFP",

Tilda always came prepared for each meeting we had, armed with several resources for just about any question or challenge I had. She is transparent and receptive. Her commitment to making sure she delivers the very best to each and every individual she works with is a testament to her dedication to the work she does. I was so impressed by the level of depth of knowledge she has. She really helped me fine tune my search efforts, resume, networking strategies, and more. I would absolutely recommend anyone work with Tilda for future opportunities, as I believe her to be an invaluable asset to any organization lucky enough to have her.”",
            "Madison Chan “I felt very fortunate to be able to work and collaborate with Tilda at Coding Dojo. A lot of people do their job because it's a job, but Tilda is someone who truly cares about it and the impact that she can have on others. She never loses sight of the individual, and went to great lengths to give our students/graduates the best support available. I also partnered with Tilda on a DEI initiative proposal to introduce ERGs at our company, and though several people worked on it, it was Tilda's passion for diversity and equality that pushed us forward and made it happen. Her passion is backed by hard work, dedication, and attention to detail. She's a team player who pushes the team to new heights.”"

        "about": "Jane Wei-Skillern is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Social Sector Leadership at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Previously, she has served on the faculty at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Harvard Business School (HBS), and London Business School. She has studied and published extensively on nonprofit networks for more than two decades.  She has also taught courses on social entrepreneurship, nonprofit strategy, and network leadership to MBAs and executives, and is the author and coauthor of dozens of publications, including journal articles and HBS and UC Berkeley Haas School of Business case studies. \n\nHer research on network leadership examines how social impact leaders, whether funders, board members, nonprofit executives or staff, that focus less on building their own institutions and instead invest to build trust based networks and a strong relational foundation in their communities can achieve dramatic gains in mission impact.  Four network principles of success that she has observed from studying leading edge nonprofit networks are:\n\n1. Mission before Organization\n2. Trust not Control\n3. Humility not Brand\n4. Constellations not Stars\n\nLeaders that demonstrate these principles in their collaborative work are better able to build robust, enduring networks, which in turn, generate social impact more efficiently, effectively, and sustainably.   This research can be found at newnetworkleader.org.\n\nFor the past several years, Jane has taken a leave from teaching in the MBA classroom to focus on supporting social impact leaders in the field to grow their impact through networks.  She is frequently invited to present keynote speeches, webinars, and workshops to share her research on network leadership and to facilitate the development of trust based collaborations within organizations and communities. \n\nSpecialties: social entrepreneurship, philanthropy, nonprofit strategy, leadership and management of social enterprises, nonprofit growth and management of multi-site nonprofits, nonprofit networks, network leadership.\n\nMore information about Jane's research and teaching can be found at:  newnetworkleader.org and https://haas.berkeley.edu/cssl/faculty/si-fellows-visiting-scholars/",

In fact, there is a method to working more efficiently and effectively through networks, and a critical first step for grantmakers is adopting a network mindset, which may require dramatic shifts in attitude and behavior for some. Cracking the Network Code outlines four principles that comprise the network mindset, illustrates the principles with a range of examples of networks that have achieved real results, and offers practical questions and recommendations to help grantmakers achieve the benefits and avoid common pitfalls of working through networks."

I initiated study groups in order to more effectively master the materials. \n\nI originally gained my business communication skills working at my family's small business, Eden L Market, a Oaxacan market known for its authentic Latin foods, drinks, spices, and craftwork. I continued to apply my work ethic and skills in my most recent positions, working at the Counseling Center at Santa Monica College and Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. \n\nDuring my transition from college, I have temporarily returned to work at Eden L Market as Department Manager, learning more about operating a small business, enhancing customer relationship, and improving my Spanish. I am working both independently and in teams, gaining leadership skills, and resolving customer and employee issues. \n\nI look forward to achieving a professional position that makes use of both my academic training and my practical business skills. \n\n",

I firmly believe that computational solutions are the next frontier. I am characterized from my unyielding appetite for learning new things, constantly setting and achieving complex goals, and creating opportunities to apply my newfound knowledge in innovative ways. I hold myself responsible to always strive for greatness, whether building new relationships, or leading the next frontier in computational solutions.\n\n♦ My passion for data and AI is exemplified by utilizing Google's open-source machine learning library TensorFlow to invent a Smart Wildfire Sensor. The technology helps predict wildfires by analyzing images of the dead fuel accumulated in the forest in conjunction with other environmental factors.\n\n♦ My invention has been become globally recognized by Governments, NGOs, and tech giants, like Google. It has been my privilege to participate in the AI panel discussion at the “Google AI for Social Good,” a $25M global initiative to fund similar projects to mitigate climate change and natural disasters. \n\n♦ As a result of my efforts and expertise in the field, I have had the honor of speaking at multiple Google AI events globally, including the US and Sweden.\n\nI have graduated as a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar with a degree in Computer Science from UC Berkeley",

Aditya is a key contributor to this project, and I am excited to see him taking his talent further to make big impacts on the world!”",
            "Kevin Hartman “I had the pleasure of serving as Aditya Shah's data science capstone advisor at UC Berkeley, and I am delighted to endorse him as an exceptional data scientist. Aditya's capstone project, PoliWatch, is an AI-driven watchdog tool designed to assist journalists in researching potential conflicts of interest in the publicly disclosed stock transactions of congressional members. Aditya played a pivotal role in the project as the team's Machine Learning Engineer. He spearheaded the development of the Retriever architecture, a key component designed for retrieving and matching relevant information across disparate data sources by converting the data into vectorized embeddings using an LLM. Aditya's technical expertise and focused approach were instrumental in the success of the project. His sharp intellect and unwavering focus were evident throughout the project, showcasing both his technical prowess and commitment to achieving excellence. Aditya and his team went above and beyond, not only in delivering an effective presentation but also in producing a complete and well-scoped product, demonstrating their dedication to the entire project lifecycle. Aditya's ability to contribute meaningfully to the team, coupled with his technical skills, make him stand out as a remarkable data scientist. It was a pleasure working with Aditya, and I am confident that he will continue to make significant contributions in the field of data science. I highly recommend Aditya Shah to any organization seeking a talented and focused professional in the realm of data science.”"

My time at Cal gave me a solid knowledge foundation as well as a complex, diverse lexicon surrounding WHY DATA MATTERS. \n\nIn addition to using my training in data science and analytics, I constantly examine the human side of data. Data stewardship, privacy, ethics, and contextualization of data are not only concepts to me, but skills and experience that I actively practice. I am excited to demonstrate my understanding of HOW DATA WORKS as well as HOW INFORMATION FUELS DECISIONS AND PROGRESS. \n\nMy experiences cover the entire data life cycle – I've worked with information that begins on paper and ends with decision-making at all levels of organizations. This background, alongside my dedication to humanity as it interacts with data, allows me to draw insightful conclusions about the world, my organizations, and the data in front of me. I love puzzling and problem-solving, especially when it comes to WHAT MAKES DATA HAPPEN. \n\nMy work history has given me insight into a broad range of communities and diversity in interests. I am committed to promoting equity and justice, and as a queer/trans person, I understand the importance of asking WHO IS THE STAKEHOLDER.\n\nI'm proud to say that I have explored many opportunities throughout COVID. Having graduated into a pandemic, I've evolved alongside the WFH culture and the challenges that come with it. I am finally settling into my positionality as a data professional, and am excited to see what challenges and insights exist in my future.",

The registration mechanism can also be used to export resource information. The prefix and resource information can then be passed on to a Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) Location Server, which in turn can propagate that routing information within and between Internet Telephony Administrative Domains (ITADs). TGREP shares a lot of similarities with the TRIP protocol. It has similar procedures and finite state machine for session establishment. It also shares the same format for messages and a subset of attributes with TRIP."

Since we believe that no one should face a revolution without appropriate armaments, this paper presents BUCKY, a new benchmark for object relational database systems. BUCKY is a query oriented benchmark that tests many of the key features offered by object-relational systems, including row types and inheritance, references and path expressions, sets of atomic values and of references, methods and late binding and user-defined abstract data types and their methods. To test the maturity of object-relational technology relative to relational technology, we provide both an object-relational version of BUCKY and a relational equivalent thereof (ie. a relational BUCKY simulation). Finally, we briefly discuss the initial performance results and lessons that resulted from applying BUCKY to one of the early object-relational database system products."

I’ve worked on everything from K-12 education to health care, but my primary focus is housing and overlapping areas of urban policy. I am currently a housing policy fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and a member of the EQ Collaborative.\n\nI was previously the policy director for California YIMBY (“Yes in My Backyard”), which is working to end California’s housing crisis through state-level policy change. Prior to that, I served as policy manager for the UCSF Benioff Housing and Homelessness Initiative, an academic institute that researches and advocates for evidence-based strategies to end homelessness. I have also worked as a fiscal and policy advisor to the California state legislature.\n\nIn addition, I’m a seasoned journalist and editor with bylines in The New York Times, msnbc.com, The New Republic, The San Francisco Chronicle, and various other publications. I’m currently working on a book about cities for Island Press, with an expected publication date of Fall 2026.\n\nI hold a Masters in Public Policy from UC Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy. I live in the East Bay with my wife, daughter, and cat.",

My coursework, projects, and teaching experience during my undergraduate years at UC Berkeley have helped me grow. \n\nTeaching an adjunct group of 20 students from diverse backgrounds three times a week, with the UC Berkeley Student Learning Center, allowed me to expand my communication and interpersonal skills, and also to develop a deeper appreciation for people’s different viewpoints.  Working with others, be it preparing a lesson plan with another adjunct instructor or simply working together with other drop-in tutors to answer student questions, has taught me the beauty and power of collaboration. \n\nTraits like these have helped me make a significant impact in the environment I have worked in. As a recent graduate seeking a full-time position, I would love to find the right company/organization to which I could contribute using my skill set. I would be more than happy to connect with other professionals in this field, and am open to internship and externship opportunities.",

My name is Luka Cheney and I am a recent graduate of UC Berkeley where I double majored in Data/Computer Science (emphasis Computational Biology) and Cognitive Science (emphasis in Neuroscience).\n\nI am experienced in coding with Python, SQL, Java, Excel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently working on getting AWS certified and researching various Neural Network applications. I love leveraging my knowledge in statistics and my visualization abilities to perform meaningful data analysis projects as well. On top of my coding experience, I took as many Neuroscience and Genetics classes as possible at UC Berkeley. This has allowed me to work on many bioinformatics and biotech projects. I hope to one day get my masters in Bioinformatics, but until then, I am happy to work in any sector with Data Science or Software Engineering.\n\nI am versatile, hard-working, and always looking to learn more about my field. Please feel free to contact me at lukajcheney@gmail.com for any professional inquiries!",

I’m Andrew, a fifth-year undergraduate pursuing a double major in Political Science (with Highest Honors) and Psychology and a minor in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am currently studying abroad at the School of Psychology at the University of Padua until July 2025.\n\nI am passionate about studying the intersections between politics, psychology, data, and education. In particular, I am interested in researching the psychosocial factors that influence public opinion, especially biases, social pressure, and the lack of accurate information, through laboratory and field experiments.\n\nOutside of my own academics and research, I’m committed to empowering students to accomplish their personal and academic ambitions by ensuring that all students are well-equipped with the resources they need to succeed through my work with multiple student organizations, the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS), and the Student Learning Center (SLC) at UC Berkeley.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or at andrew_chen04 [at] berkeley [dot] edu!",

Her contribution to Edutopia has helped and inspired thousands of teachers to stay connected, stay passionate, and stay in the profession. She is an asset to any team or collaborative effort. ”",
            "Thomas Whitby “I have been working professionally with Edutopia and Elana Leoni for several years now. I have found Elana to be a consummate professional (a cliché, but still appropriate) in regard to social media in its varied forms. Her knowledge and experience of social media have been able to maximize information in answer to any of my requests. Her personal demeanor of calm confidence has always served her well in assuring people that she was the definitive “go to person” to resolve their problem. If Elana didn’t have the answer, she knew who would and would follow through with a solution or at the very least an answer. Elana’s position with Edutopia has placed her in a position to be networked with many of the most influential thought leaders in education. This has given her the ability to connect many people who would otherwise not be connected. Additionally it has educated her to the needs, desires, and solutions offered by educators on a global scale. I would without hesitation recommend Elana Leoni for any position that she felt qualified to apply for. Her maturity, professionalism, and demeanor place her heads and shoulders above many of her contemporaries. Her Social Media experience is both extensive and relevant, which is a rare combination in today’s fast paced changing world. In our technology-driven society a candidate like Elana Leoni is a rare find and will be an asset to any company fortunate enough to find her. ”"

We urge the NTIA to consider AI accountability through a framework of human rights. First, we address transparency & accountability through the perspective of due process. Then, we provide information on the “right to know”, urging that AI accountability measures include the requirement that individuals should be notified when an automated decision has been made about them. Finally, we conclude with information and suggestions for stakeholder involvement, a part of AI accountability that we believe to be unwaveringly necessary."

In the study, participants without prior experience with Morse code reached 6.7 wpm with a Morse code keyboard in three short sessions. Learning was observed both in terms of text entry speed and accuracy, which suggests that the overall performance of the keyboard is likely to improve with practice."

        "about": "I had originally considered pursuing a psychology major as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, but my professors kindly suggested to me that people who ask the question “why” enough are less suited toward psychology as they are for other fields, such as philosophy. So, I made that switch, entirely anticipating that I would pursue a career either in academia (which I wouldn’t necessarily enjoy), or law (which I may have enjoyed, but I couldn’t afford to pay for law school). \n\nHowever, I ultimately became very passionate about the movement of information itself and the effective presentation of ideas, which motivated me to take my writing very seriously and, more specifically, to accept a leadership position at Think Deeply, Write Clearly.\n\nHere's the thing that I learned along the way, and accordingly, why I’m highly passionate about the work I’m doing now:\nIf we ask “why” enough, if we investigate ideas to their core, there is an actionable assessment somewhere. In other words, there is a depth of information that is reliably consistent from which we can then make informed decisions. This is the actionable piece of information that not only a client needs to know about a business that is providing services (e.g., why the client should hire you rather than the other people in this space), but also the actionable piece of advice each of us need in all areas of life, in order to foster better cultural discussions, better academic discussions, better connections in our relationships and in our careers.\n\nMy purpose is to build relationships and investigate ideas with as many of the thoughtful people I can here on LinkedIn. \n\nIf that investigation sounds interesting to you, please accept this open invitation to an introductory chat—I’d love to learn more about you and your business, and develop a relationship through LinkedIn with you.\n",

Skilled in managing cross-functional teams, leading stakeholder engagement, and driving complex projects from strategy to execution. Experienced in policy analysis, strategic planning, and business process improvement, with a focus on adapting stakeholder strategies across diverse regional markets. Known for empathetic leadership, operational insight, and a creative mindset shaped by passions for photography, film, and music.\n\nThat love for structure spills into my home life too. Whether it’s organizing a cabinet full of spices or untangling a drawer full of charging cables, I’m wired to believe there’s always a slightly better way to do things — something that improves quality, reduces friction, and saves time.\n\nAlways open to thoughtful conversations — especially around strategy, storytelling, and systems that actually work. I also get excited to discuss plant care, the NBA, and curating the perfect playlist. Let’s connect!",

My research investigates activists’ efforts to curtail systemic racism, transform political spheres of exclusion, and institutionalize radical diversity. At Spelman College, I explored protests for racial-ethnic inclusion in Argentina and South Africa. As a UC Berkeley PhD student, I work as an academic researcher, organizational coding specialist, and undergraduate program director to identify and implement strategies that increase feelings of belonging, amplify equity, and achieve social justice for marginal groups. My goal is to merge my doctoral training in sociology with my assessments of DEIB in international businesses across sectors to inform sustainable social change in collegiate and corporate institutions. \n\nMy skills entail teaching, project management, professional development, qualitative research methods (survey, interview, and participant observation) and grant writing. I received my B.A. in Sociology from Spelman College and my M.A. in Sociology from the University of California, Berkeley. I also completed the field-based Social Movements Program in Buenos Aires, Argentina with the School for International Training.",

The fellowship contributes to realizing the department&apos;s goals of advancing equity, inclusion, and diversity in the areas of department climate, community building, and curriculum. I served as one of the three Community Builder Fellows, who were tasked with coordinating and hosting events that increased opportunities to bond, expanded professional networks, facilitated difficult dialogues, and orchestrated self-care activities amongst graduate students, faculty, and undergraduates."

        "about": "Cassius McNeill is a freshman at the University of California, Berkeley, intending to major in Business Administration. Motivated by a deep love for problem-solving, Cassius is drawn to the field of consulting, where he hopes to collaborate with mission-driven organizations to tackle complex challenges and create sustainable, community-centered solutions. He’s passionate about learning from forward-thinking leaders and contributing to projects that spark long-term impact.\n\nGrowing up throughout Southern California, Cassius developed the ability to adapt quickly and connect with people from all walks of life. This flexibility and adaptability continue to fuel his approach to leadership and teamwork.\n\nCassius’ commitment to uplifting others began in high school, where he served as co-president of the Fellowship for Christian Athletes (FCA) during his junior and senior years. Alongside his fellow leaders, he worked to encourage students to pursue their faith while advocating for mental health awareness, suicide prevention, and opposition to gang affiliation. Through consistent outreach, free meals at every meeting, and hosting guest speakers, Cassius helped cultivate a space where thousands of students felt seen, heard, and empowered.\n\nHe also spent several years volunteering at the House of Discipline, a martial arts school and summer program in his hometown of Spring Valley, California. There, he mentored, taught, and supported children, gaining key skills in communication, multitasking, and patience.\n\nThese formative experiences solidified Cassius’s belief in business as a tool for transformation—one that can build bridges across communities, spark innovation, and amplify the voices of youth and people of color. As he continues his undergraduate journey, Cassius is eager to explore hands-on consulting experiences that allow him to serve others by doing what he loves most: solving problems that matter.",
