We moved to my dad’s hometown in 6th grade to care for my grandmother.\n\nThat experience felt like a big adventure and so different from my protected life in California. I used public transport and rode my bike everywhere, hung out with friends and joined a swim team, had weekend dinners with my grandmother and babysat my cousins.\n\nFrom the year spent in Germany, I gained so much: life-long friends–whom I still visit every summer–language skills, German culture, but most importantly, I learned to be open to change. It turned out to be one of the best years of my life. I entered the German school unsure, scared for what was to come. I left realizing that I can tackle any challenge and that being open to change and new ideas makes me happy.\nSubsequently, I tried out lots of new things, from becoming a soccer referee for competitive club games (which was fun except for the yelling parents) to volunteering at the animal shelter (I love dogs!!) to tutoring English learners in my high school (they shared amazing life experiences).\n\nNow that I am in college, in a much larger and more diverse environment, I am surrounded by so many different people with various backgrounds every day, whether they are from my hometown or halfway across the world. I love learning about their experiences and building new relationships.",

            "Charesse Spiller “Candice is personable, highly adaptable, and a motivated, up and coming professional. As the founder of a growing firm, I was looking to start working with interns who could easily plug-in to the company in a remote capacity. Candice's spring internship was focused on SOP development and selecting the best technology tool to support our processes and team structure. Candice did an exceptional job at comparing the best options for the SOP software, refining our existing processes, and creating new SOPs for our future consultants. As a result of Candice's time at Level Best, we now have our SOPs documented for our main service offerings, we are onboarding new team members seamlessly, and have a go forward action plan with how to maintain the work that Candice started. I am so grateful for Candice's contribution to the success of Level Best and I believe she would be an asset to any company she chooses to work with.”"

As an Investment Analyst Intern at Whales Capital, I authored comprehensive reports on SaaS, including front office application, healthcare IT, supply chain management and manufacturing execution systems, which guided the firm's $500K strategic investment allocation. Moreover, my project experience has helped me to fill the gap between knowledge and application.\n\nI am now taking courses related to the finance field, and networking with more professionals.

            "Eddie Lin “I first met Elisa when she was selected for the Citi Ventures CUPID program. After working with her on Citi projects, she could easily have been my colleague at UBS Investment Bank or Goldman Sachs. What impressed me most was her natural intellectual curiosity and spirit of continuous improvement. She always delivered more than what she was asked every single week, and did so with great joy and enthusiasm. She also has a great spirit of entrepreneurship, without being asked she took the initiative in learning how to model her own CDO as part of a strategy to help underbanked Americans. The mindfulness of social impact while helping grow business leveraging the core revenue model of a commercial and investment bank is a thought process well beyond her years. I do not take for granted she was always early to every meeting, and everyone is always happy to work with her as she has a great positive energy and attitude. She did a fantastic job leading her team to a level of execution that impressed all. She is a natural presenter and followed best practices often not seen into those until well into their careers.”",
            "Ryan Zervakos “I would like to recommend Elisa for leadership in the LinkedIn Student Learning Champion program. As one of the LinkedIn leads for this program, I have become acquainted with Elisa in her various and wide-ranging roles and contributions across the campus of Irvine Valley College. Elisa not only exceeded my expectations of her, but she has been continually innovating and collaborating with students from across the world. In addition to her full-time load at school, Elisa explored the suite of tools offered by LinkedIn and as needed, took courses on LinkedIn Learning to further develop soft skills. One of the key components of this program is sharing experiences and stories of learning achievement and career readiness. Elisa engaged in several initiatives aimed at bringing awareness to and engagement with LinkedIn Learning. However, Elisa steered away from merely completing the required tasks and instead challenged herself to create, plan and implement a powerful online presence. Elisa initiated conversations through posts and articles on the LinkedIn feed as well as pursued a series of campaigns that ranged from face-to-face public speaking events for clubs and campus events to online video campaigns that told the both the personal and professional journey of attending a higher education institution in pursuit of career goals. One example of her dedication is how she collaborated with several other LiL Champions to create a podcast on Spotify spreading the message to any student on the value of both LinkedIn and LinkedIn Learning. As a member of this program, Elisa was a dedicated and excellent contributor. As a participant, she was a diligent, intelligent, committed person who, in every instance, went beyond the minimum requirements of whatever she was asked to do – even helping others along the way. She has excellent management skills, compassionately interacts with students, team members and managers in a professional and friendly manner. She is a self- starter, a problem-solver, a team player, a good communicator, and a fair and reasonable person when difficult choices present themselves. She isn’t afraid to seek answers to difficult questions and is ready to apply critical problem-solving skills to any situation—technical, professional, or academic. I am very enthusiastic when it comes to Elisa. She is a passionate person, a professional, and a voice of caring and humor in a constantly changing world. That perfect blend of humanity and strategic problem-solving skills is a requirement for any role today, and its these qualities that will inevitably lead to remarkable opportunities for Elisa to serve others. ”"

Under the CUPID Program, CitiBank/Citi Ventures is looking to develop a pipeline of California community college students from which to recruit for employment. The “Capstone to Career” project through CUPID allows students to test the waters in a real-world, experiential format and is more simplified than a formal internship process.The program offers a series of digital badges with subjects ranging from bitcoin to blockchain, smart cities to securities, personal finance, capital markets, and others. The digital badges can be assigned as class assignment, course complement, extra project, or as a group club/organizational challenge. To qualify for the interview phase of CUPID, students had to pass 3 Citi exams, complete 3 essays, and forward their resume. Many students across California completed all 3 Citi exams for consideration into the Citi CUPID Capstone program as part of their courses. Students were selected based on writing samples simulating on-the-job responsibilities.As part of the process, a California Community College Student Event was also held on interview tips & career opportunities. Hundreds of California Community College students signed-up to hear directly from Citi senior leadership on the opportunities and day-to-day responsibilities at the world’s largest global financial services institution. Students received interview tips on how to secure careers at the firm."

While I intend to pursue an MBA after gaining more experience in the investment industry, I will strive to keep music in my life as a means to constantly listen to, learn from, and collaborate with others.",

        "about": "Class of 2026 at UC Berkeley, pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Economics and Policy with a focus on sustainability, financial markets, and investment strategies. My academic journey has been enriched by study experiences at Harvard and the University of Chicago, building a solid foundation in finance and environmental policy.\n\nMy professional experience spans private equity, investment banking, and strategic consulting. As a Private Equity Intern at Caprae Capital Partners, I contributed to acquisition strategies and conducted market research to support growth initiatives. During my Investment Banking Summer Internship at Huatai United Securities, I gained experience in IPO processes and compliance frameworks. At Deloitte Consulting, I honed my skills in strategic risk advisory by analyzing dealership networks for a leading automobile company.\n\nDriven by a commitment to sustainability, I co-founded Carbon Trail Assess and Carbon Era—two ventures focused on carbon footprint management and carbon asset trading. Carbon Trail Assess provides SMEs with strategic carbon solutions, while Carbon Era is a comprehensive carbon trading platform, serving over 2,200 controlled-emission enterprises in China. Both ventures leverage data analytics to simplify carbon trading and help businesses achieve sustainable growth.\n\nIn 2024, I joined both the World Economic Forum’s 1t.org Youth Hub as one of four representatives from China and the UNDP INSPIRO Young Entrepreneurs Network for SDGs. These global communities allow me to collaborate with youth leaders on ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development, advocating for transformative, youth-led solutions on platforms like the Davos Forum.\n\nCurrently, I’m expanding my financial knowledge through the Berkeley Investment Group’s Fundamentals of Investing Decal, where I’m learning valuation models and investment strategies to prepare for future roles in finance and sustainability.\n\nI’m passionate about merging finance with environmental solutions. Let’s connect if you’re interested in discussing innovative projects in finance, sustainability, or environmental policy.",

            "Ryan B. “Bautista is an incredibly bright and skilled young man. He applied to the Executive Vice President's office for an intern position, but while conducting his interview it was evident that he was more than qualified to be leading a department. With his unselfish manner and clear passion for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, believing in him, we appointed Bautista to be an Executive Director of the Operations and Finance department as a freshman admit/first-year student. His leadership and vibrant personality cultivated a working environment that allowed his department to flourish and achieve great heights. Ops and Finance was undoubtedly the most productive department in the OEVP, and also one of the most productive throughout the entire ASUC during the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 school year. His contributions to the office contributed to the OEVP demystifying the stigma behind first-year leadership in the ASUC. What Bautista was able to accomplish as a freshman student-executive director will probably never be replicated in the ASUC ever again. He is way ahead of so many not just in maturity, perspective, and leadership but also as an academic scholar and person. His appointment to this role is one of the decisions I will remember fondly when looking back at my time as ASUC OEVP Chief of Staff. It was an absolute pleasure to work with him.”"

Despite being one of the youngest members in a cohort that included master’s and post-graduate students, Bodhi consistently stood out as a remarkable professional. His technical abilities and quantitative aptitude were exceptional, and he approached every task with efficiency, precision, and a kind demeanor. Bodhi’s hard-working and driven nature, coupled with his ability to adapt and excel in a challenging environment, made him an invaluable member of the team. I can confidently recommend Bodhi to any organization. He is a fantastic professional with immense potential, and I have no doubt he will continue to achieve great things in his career.”",

He approached every project with attention to detail, diving deep into data. His research was not only comprehensive but also thoughtfully analyzed. I have no doubt that Knoton has a bright future ahead.”",
            "Stephen Monk “It was a privilege to work with Knoton when he was an analyst at my search fund, and I could not recommend him more highly. In addition to being diligent, thoughtful, and tenaciously detail-oriented, he brought a genuine enthusiasm that will benefit the culture of any organization lucky enough to hire him. Knoton is both intellectually curious and highly coachable, and he is proactive about developing his skillset. I look forward to watching Knoton’s finance career develop – I have no doubt he will be extremely successful.”"

Because of these factors, I knew our duty had to be to keep each other “off-the-streets” and make sure that we grew up to be good citizens and successful young men with life goals that exceed those of our peers. In order to do this we host professional workshops, networking events, and tutoring for members. We believed that diversity was our strength and would lead to our success. I took it upon myself to invite other people in the city and around the country with like-minded goals in challenging situations. Since we began expanding, we now have members across Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. To bring all of our members together we participate in an annual retreat where we all go on a vacation during the summer to have a good time and share ideas. All of our members have successfully graduated from high school and are enrolled in 4 year universities, 75% being first generation college students and 50% being first generation high school graduates. XBG's mission is not over yet, XBG is a support system for life and we will continue to assist our members in every stage of their career.\n            \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show less",
